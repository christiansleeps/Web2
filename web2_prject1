      Hey, my name is Christian. I like animation, illustration, and intimidation.
      I'm a Graphic Design Major. My favorite color was navy blue,
      but then it became turquoise/ teal, and now it might be deep purple. I guess
       I'm just attracted to cool colors B')

      I like to call myself "the Perspiring Artist". People always ask me if I meant <b> aspiring </b> artist.
      I tell them no, and to back off; you don't know me like that. I adopted the name because
      I always put 200% into every piece of art that I create! ...And also I maybe
       sweat a lot. Like a lot. Indiscriminately. (I should get that checked out...)

      Lately, I don't really do much online other than watch videos. Videos like <a href="https://youtu.be/7z1NxSurT8A">this one</a> help me to find inner peace.
      And I honestly can't count the amount of sleepless nights that were remedied by <a href="https://youtu.be/i6zaVYWLTkU">this</a> video. And on particularly rough days,
      if nothing else seems to work, I can always count on <a href="https://twitter.com/cursedimages">this gem of a page</a> to quell any lingering, negative thoughts. I encourage you to try!
